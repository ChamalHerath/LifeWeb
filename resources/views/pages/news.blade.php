                            record of Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) qualifiers to achieve with the first ever Court of
                            the Table (COT) achiever in its history of 23 years, 11 MDRT including 01 COT qualifier for the
                            year 2021. The Company is moving forefront in terms of new business generation in life insurance
                            over the past couple of years.</li><br>
                        <li>MDRT is a global, independent association of the world’s leading life insurance and financial
                            services professionals with 66,000 members in 72 countries from more than 500 of the world’s

                            re-apply for membership annually to ensure they continue to meet MDRT standards. Court of the
                            Table and Top of the Table membership allows members to access the highest level of member
                            benefits and recognition exclusively for them. Therefore, the next milestone of the company is

                            advancement. We invest significantly on human development and its digitization which believes to
                            be the leading-edge in continuous improvement of the business.</li><br>
